## Introduction

In November 2018, I enrolled in the Codecademy Machine Learning Fundamentals course as I've always been interested in machine learning and using various algorithms to generate insights. This repository contains the files for the capstone project, Date A Scientist.

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## Instructions

1. Clone or download the repository

2. Unzip the file with profile data, which can be found in the `/data` directory

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and set the location of the `profiles.csv` file that you unzipped in step 2

4. Using Jupyter Notebook, run all cells. Please note that due to a script that loops through a series of float numbers to obtain the best gamma value for a Support Vector Machine model, the total run time is approximately 3-5 minutes.

5. Review the presentation, which provides an overview of my preliminary research, research questions, process, conclusions, and next steps. The presentation can be found in this repository.
